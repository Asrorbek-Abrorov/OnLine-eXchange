OLX Clone using ASP.NET Core Web API

This project is a clone of the OLX website implemented using ASP.NET Core Web API. The goal of this project is to replicate the core functionalities of OLX, providing users with a platform to buy and sell goods.
Features:

    ASP.NET Core Web API: Utilizing ASP.NET Core for building robust and scalable web APIs.
    Controller-based Web API: Implemented using controller-based approach for handling HTTP requests.
    Dependency Injection: Employing dependency injection for managing dependencies and promoting modular code.
    Repository Pattern: Utilizing the repository pattern for abstracting data access and improving testability.
    Entity Framework Core (EF Core): Integrating EF Core for data persistence and ORM.
    Online Database: Utilizing an online database for storing application data.
    Swagger Architecture: Employing Swagger for API documentation and testing, enhancing API discoverability.
    N-Tier Architecture: Following N-Tier architecture for better separation of concerns and scalability.

Technologies Used:

    ASP.NET Core: A cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based, internet-connected applications.
    Entity Framework Core: A lightweight, extensible, open-source ORM framework for .NET.
    Swagger: An open-source tool for documenting APIs built with OpenAPI Specification.
    C#: The primary programming language used for implementing backend logic.
    Online Database (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL): Utilizing a reliable online database for data storage and retrieval.
    Dependency Injection: Leveraging built-in dependency injection features of ASP.NET Core.
    N-Tier Architecture: Organizing the project into separate layers for presentation, business logic, and data access.OLX Clone using ASP.NET Core Web API
